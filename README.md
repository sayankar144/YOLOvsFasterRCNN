## 🎥 Demo Video

https://github.com/sayankar144/YOLOvsFasterRCNN/blob/main/output_detected3.mp4 <br>
This project uses two object detection models: **(1) Faster R-CNN** and **(2) YOLOv11** for comparative analysis.

This project evaluates both models based on **accuracy (mAP)**, **inference speed (FPS)**, and **model size**.

## 🔄 Data Augmentation

To improve model robustness and generalization, a carefully designed data augmentation pipeline was applied using **Albumentations**.  
The augmentations were selected to simulate realistic camera motion, lighting variations, and mild blur conditions commonly observed in real-world video streams.

### Applied Augmentations
- **Shift, Scale, and Rotation**  
  Simulates minor camera movement and object displacement.
  - Shift limit: ±5%
  - Scale limit: ±8%
  - Rotation limit: ±5°
  - Probability: 0.7

- **Motion Blur**  
  Mimics motion-induced blur in video frames.
  - Blur kernel limit: 5
  - Probability: 0.3

- **Gaussian Blur**  
  Applies mild smoothing to reduce overfitting to sharp edges.
  - Kernel size: 3–5
  - Probability: 0.2

- **Random Brightness & Contrast**  
  Handles illumination changes across different environments.
  - Brightness limit: ±15%
  - Contrast limit: ±15%
  - Probability: 0.3

- **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**  
  Enhances local contrast under poor lighting conditions.
  - Clip limit: 2.0
  - Tile grid size: 8×8
  - Probability: 0.1 (applied sparingly)

###  Qualitative Observations
- Faster R-CNN produces tighter bounding box and more stable output but very heavy and complex model
- YOLO is not perform better in real time but simple to write code and very light weight
